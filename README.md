# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : December 28, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things needed to learn Machine learning. I have decided to use google colab for coding. And also found some interesting [tutorials](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/) online.

## Day 1 : January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned the basics of Numpy .

**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Numpy.ipynb)

## Day 2 : January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned the basics of matplotlib and implemented them.

**Link of Work:**  [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Matplotlib.ipynb)

## Day3 : January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned Logistic Regression and implemented it to solve [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) problem on Kaggle.

## Day 4 : January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned about data imputation and linear regression. Did a project on BigMart sales prediction. I used Linear Regression to predict the sales. And learned about data imputation. I took the project from this [link](https://www.dezyre.com/project-use-case/predict-big-mart-sales)
