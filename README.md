# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : December 28, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things needed to learn Machine learning. I have decided to use google colab for coding. And also found some interesting [tutorials](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/) online.

## Day 1 : January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned the basics of Numpy .

**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Numpy.ipynb)

## Day 2 : January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned the basics of matplotlib and implemented them.

**Link of Work:**  [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Matplotlib.ipynb)

## Day3 : January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned Logistic Regression and implemented it to solve [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) problem on Kaggle.

**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)

## Day 4 : January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned about data imputation and linear regression. Did a project on BigMart sales prediction. I used Linear Regression to predict the sales. And learned about data imputation. I took the project from this [link](https://www.dezyre.com/project-use-case/predict-big-mart-sales)
 
**Link of Work:**   [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Bigmart_Sales_Predictions.ipynb)

## Day 5 : January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Did a project on twitter sentiment analysis. Learned how to process the strigs inside the dataset. Got the project from [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/hands-on-sentiment-analysis-dataset-python/) but didn't use the same dataset. But I could't complete the entire analysis. So I will do it again tomorrow.

## Day 6 : January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Tried to do twitter sentiment analysis again but couldn't complete due to some unkonown errors. [Here](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Learning-ML/blob/master/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_2.ipynb) is the link to the failed work.

## Day 7 : January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned how to deal with time series. Tried to do a project on air passengers prediction using ARIMA. But couldn't complete. I will continue with the same tomorrow. I got the project from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/freespirit08/time-series-for-beginners-with-arima) and tried to learn the process.

**Link of work** : [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Learning-ML/blob/master/Air_Passengers_Prediction.ipynb)
    
   I also created a jupiter notebook template which tells you what are the steps to be done during a text analysis. Here's the [link](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Learning-ML/blob/master/Text_Analysis_Template.ipynb)

## Day 8 : February 1 , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Completed the time series analysis using ARIMA model.

**Link of Work** : [Commit](https://github.com/GopiMindgloer/Learning-ML/blob/master/Air_Passengers_Prediction.ipynb)

## Day 9 : February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Tried to do iris flower classification using keras but failed.

**Link of Work** : [Commit](https://github.com/Damntoochill/Learning-ML/blob/master/Iris_classifier_using_Keras.ipynb)

## Day 10 : February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Learned how to download stock market data using nsepy and did some basic EDA. Couldn't do much :(

**Link of Work** : [Commit](https://github.com/Damntoochill/Learning-ML/blob/master/Algorithmic_Trading_1.ipynb)

## Day 11 : February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Tried to do [House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) but the dataset was too big so I couldn't even do a perfect EDA.

**Link of Work** : [Commit](https://github.com/Damntoochill/Learning-ML/blob/master/House_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

## Day 12 : February 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress** : Learned about different time series forecasting models. And tests for checking the stationarity of a time series.

**Link of Work** : [commit](https://github.com/Damntoochill/Learning-ML/blob/master/Statistics/stationarity.ipynb)

## Day 13 : February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress** : Tried to predict shampoo sales using ARIMA. I wasn't successfull but still learned a lot.

**Link of Work** : [Commit](https://github.com/Damntoochill/Learning-ML/blob/master/Shampoo_sales_Prediction.ipynb)

## Day 14 : February 17. 2019
